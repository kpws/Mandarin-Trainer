This program lets you excercise on recognizing some Chinese characters and see their pronounciation. 
The default character set match (at time of programming) the first course in Putonghua on HKUST for English speakers.
The program saves statistics about your learning in ~/.mandarinTrainerHist. It is tested and works on Linux and mac,
though a terminal with support for Chinese characters is needed.

Sorry for bad code. It's just a fast hack but it works.
